## Overview

### Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned:
### how to approach a project
  - I learnt how to approach a project before even before any of the coding or even thinking of what i'm technologies i'm going to use. Look at the project, know it's semantics that is what the heading or piece of information means maybe why it is there in that particular place, if possible make research of how other ideas of the same project look like. This helps you to build your confidence.
### how to divide a project
  - I learnt how to divide my project into smaller pieces. This is the most important thing in all the things i learnt from this because it helped me not only in this project but in all my tasks.If you're a new into tech and your intimidated on how other developers have to write into like hundreds of files, don't worry because it's just a gigantic task broken down into smaller tasks

     **(this can also help you have personal project ideas, you might ask yourself "Why can't i make a tool that helps me automate this group of tasks?")**
### how to write real resets
 - If you're a hard CSS coder this might be helpful and the reason it is really helpful is because for a long time a lot of developers have issues with simple styles just because of not writing real resets and when i mean real  resets i don't mean this:
 ```css
 * {
  margin:0;
  padding:0;
  box-sizing:border-box;
 }
 ```
I mean resets on almost every element you use in your code like html, headings , paragraphs, unorderd lists buttons and many other elements. This is because almost all these elements have default styles and to be honest these default styles are looked on by most of the devs in the tech industry and yet cause chaos during your styling and you know what i mean:
 - You're trying to give something padding or margin but its not moving at all and you're so pissed at yourself like 😠


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```
